## Introduction

Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language that is widely used in web development, data science, automation, and more. This repository is designed for beginners who want to learn Python from scratch, starting with basic syntax and culminating in simple projects that reinforce the concepts learned.

### Why Python?

- **Readable and simple syntax:** Python code is clear and easy to write.
- **Versatile:** Python can be used in web development, data science, automation, machine learning, and more.
- **Large Community and Ecosystem:** With a vast array of libraries and frameworks, Python is suited for both beginners and professionals.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12 or later**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- A text editor or IDE (such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)).

To check if Python is installed, open your terminal and run:

```bash
python3 --version
```
````

This should print the Python version.

### Installing Python (if necessary)

If you don't have Python installed, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS:

```bash
brew install python
```

## Basic Python Syntax

This repository covers fundamental Python concepts, including:

- Variables and Data Types: integers, floats, strings, booleans.
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation.
- Functions: how to define and call functions.

### Example Code Snippet

```python
# Variables and Data Types
x = 10  # Integer
y = 3.14  # Float
name = "Python"  # String
is_active = True  # Boolean

# Simple Arithmetic
sum_result = x + y
print("Sum:", sum_result)
```

## Project: Simple Calculator

As part of this repository, we have included a simple Python calculator project. The calculator takes user input and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Calculator Features:

- Add two numbers
- Subtract two numbers
- Multiply two numbers
- Divide two numbers (handling division by zero)

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevBillyM/python-beginner-projects.git
   cd python-beginner-projects
   ```

2. Run the calculator project using Python:

   ```bash
   python3 calculator.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to perform arithmetic calculations.

## Next Steps

- Try adding more operations to the calculator (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
- Refactor the calculator to loop continuously until the user exits.
- Explore other basic Python topics like loops, conditionals, and error handling.
